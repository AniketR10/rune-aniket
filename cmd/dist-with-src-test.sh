# Regression test for the .go-source publish gate (verify-no-go-source.sh).
#
# For every component's dist.sh, this drives the real script against a
# STUB artifact that intentionally contains a .go file and asserts the
# script aborts before reaching the publish step. A fake bluectl/gsutil
# is placed first on PATH so any attempt to publish is itself a failure:
# the gate must fire first.
#
# Usage: dist-with-src-test.sh <tar|dmg>
#   tar  - build a .tar.gz stub and run it through every dist.sh
#   dmg  - build a .dmg stub (macOS/hdiutil only) and run it through
#          every dist.sh
