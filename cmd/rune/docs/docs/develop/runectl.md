# runectl

`runectl` is Rune's command-line companion: a small CLI that runs as an
external process and communicates with a running Rune workspace as a
plugin. It is the fast path to integrating with Rune. Where a full
[extension](./sdk/index.md) is the right tool when you want to ship UI, register
commands, or run a long-lived process inside Rune, `runectl` lets a shell
script, a Makefile target, an editor hook, or a one-off command reach
into the workspace without writing any code.

Because it is just a CLI that reads and writes plain text, it composes
with the rest of your environment: pipe its output through `jq`, `grep`,
`fzf`, or anything else, and pipe other tools' output back into it.

## Install

`runectl` is distributed as a Rune package. Install it from the
[Rune console](../learn/console.md) with:

```
pkg install runectl
```

(or `console pkg install runectl` from the command prompt). Once installed,
`runectl` is on your `PATH` inside Rune's terminals.

## How it finds the workspace

Commands you run from a Rune terminal target the right workspace
automatically, with no flags or configuration. That is also why hooks and
scripts spawned by tools running inside Rune just work.

## What you can do

Run `runectl help` to see every command, or `runectl <command> --help`
for a specific one. The main groups:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `runectl notify <level> <message>` | Post a Rune notification (`error`, `warn`, `info`, `success`). |
| `runectl open <uri>` | Open a resource in the workspace. |
| `runectl uri <path>` | Resolve a filesystem path to a workspace URI. |
| `runectl datadir` | Print the extension data directory. |
| `runectl exec -- <cmd> [args...]` | Run a command through the workspace executor. |
| `runectl editor ...` | Read and edit buffer text, cursors, and location lists. |
| `runectl wm ...` | Window-manager actions: focus, split, float, close. |
| `runectl lsp ...` | Language-server queries: definitions, references, diagnostics, rename, symbols, and more. |
| `runectl syntax ...` | Tree-sitter searches and structural queries across the workspace. |
| `runectl storage ...` | Create, read, update, and delete extension documents. |
| `runectl llm ...` | Talk to the workspace's model router. |
| `runectl mcp` | Start an MCP server over stdio exposing Rune's syntax and LSP tools. |

Most commands accept a `-F`/`--format` flag to choose the output format:
`table` (the default, human-readable), `json` (for piping into other
tools), or a Go template for custom shaping.

## Composing with POSIX tools

The point of `runectl` is to get things out of Rune and into your
environment, and back. The examples below mix and match the command
groups to show the range.

**Notify on a long build, from outside Rune.** Kick off a build in a
plain terminal and have the workspace tab light up when it lands, even if
you have wandered off to another workspace:

```
make build && runectl notify success "build done" || runectl notify error "build failed"
```

**Code-review the buffer you are staring at.** Pull the live text of an
open editor with `editor print` and send it to the workspace's model
router (`llm message` takes the prompt as an argument), then read the
review back in your terminal:

```
runectl llm message gemini/gemini-3.5-flash "Review this Go file for bugs and edge cases: $(runectl editor print ./convert.go)"
```

**Turn diagnostics into a commit gate.** Count workspace errors and fail
a pre-commit hook if any remain:

```
errors=$(runectl lsp workspace-diagnostics --format json | jq '[.[] | select(.severity == "error")] | length')
[ "$errors" -eq 0 ] || { runectl notify error "$errors errors, commit blocked"; exit 1; }
```

**Ask the language server about a symbol by name.** The `lsp`
subcommands accept a bare symbol, so you do not need to hunt down a file,
line, and column. Read a type's hover documentation:

```
runectl lsp hover term.Writer
```

```go
type Writer interface { // size=16 (0x10)
	// Context returns the current context of the Writer.
	// This context can be used by tui.Components in combination
	// with term.Interrupter.Interrupt(context.Context) to disambiguate
	// regular calls to Draw from interrupt-driven calls to Draw.
	Context() context.Context
	// SetCell sets the contents of the given cell location.  If
	// the coordinates are out of range, then the operation is ignored.
	SetCell(Coordinates, Cell)
	// UnionAttributes computes the set union between a and b,
	// that is overrides a set of attributes at the given coordinates
	// that contain all the bit flags set in a, b or both, and uses the color
	// defined in b or if not set, uses the color in a.
	UnionAttributes(Coordinates, Attributes)
}
```

Locate where it is defined, list every reference, or find its
implementations the same way. Each prints the matching locations as
`<uri> <start-line>:<start-col>-<end-line>:<end-col>`, one per line:

```
runectl lsp definition term.Writer
runectl lsp references term.Writer
runectl lsp implementation term.Writer
```

Since those are just locations, pipe one into `runectl open` to open it
as a tab in the workspace:

```
runectl lsp definition term.Writer | head -n1 | cut -d' ' -f1 | xargs runectl open
```

**Drive the layout from a script.** Split the focused window and open a
file beside your code, using `wm focus` to target the active window:

```
runectl wm split "$(runectl wm focus)" ./docs/CHANGELOG.md
```

**Run a build in the workspace's environment, not your shell's.** Use the
workspace executor so the command sees the same tools and environment
Rune does:

```
runectl exec -- go test ./...
```

Because every command is line- and JSON-friendly, you can drop `runectl`
into the same pipelines you already use for everything else.
